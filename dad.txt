The Petitioner above named respectfully submits as follows: 

 

Brief facts of the case: 

 

Bharat Co-Op Bank (Mumbai) Ltd., had advanced loan to the respondent No.2 and his firm M/s. Unnathi Career Academy and to secure the said loan, the Resp.No.2 had mortgaged his office premises bearing No.4706, High point 4, 7th Floor, Bengaluru and owing to the default committed in repayment of the said loan, Bharat Co-Op Bank (Mumbai) Ltd., had initiated actions against the secured asset under the SARFAESI Act and since the Petitioner has her office in the same building at 4th floor had come across about the sale of the said property and had shown interest to participate in the bid and the representative of Bharat Co-Op Bank (Mumbai) Ltd., had shown the said property prior to the Petitioner bidding in the auction and the said property was under the lock and custody of Bharat Co-Op Bank (Mumbai) Ltd., and same was vacant when the Petitioner had visited for inspection.  

The Petitioner has learnt that, the 2nd Respondent had filed SA No.622/2022 and in the said case he had obtained conditional interim order of stay of possession notice which was not complied and said case was dismissed for default on 27/03/2024 and copy of the same are marked herein as Annexure-A. Physical possession of the secured asset was taken over by Bharat Co-Op Bank (Mumbai) Ltd., on 28/06/2023 since conditional interim order was not complied. 

Thereafter the 2nd Respondent had approached this Hon’ble Court in WP No.19270/2023 and in the said case also he had obtained conditional interim order of stay of sale notice which was not complied and copy of the interim orders passed in WP No.19270/2023 on 30/08/2023 is produced herein as Annexure-B and thus, the 2nd Respondent had been dragging the matter of recovery of the NPA accounts successfully and this Petitioner was also informed by the Bank that the 2nd Respondent had failed to close the accounts and redeem the mortgage under OTS and that’s the reason, the schedule property was put for auction. 

After physical verification of the property to be auctioned and having been satisfied with the same, the Petitioner had participated in the e-auction initiated by Bharat Co-Op Bank (Mumbai) Ltd., and the Petitioner has participated by depositing EMD amount of Rs.9,00,000/- and she has been declared as successful bidder on 28/10/2024 and after making payment of 15% of auction price of Rs.13,52,500/- on 28/10/2024 and remaining auction money of Rs.66,67,400/- was paid on 29/10/2024 and TDS of Rs.90,100/- was also deposited and after obtaining the sale certificate dated 29/10/2024, registration of the same was got done on 30/10/2024, thereafter the 2nd Respondent had approached this Hon’ble Court in WP No.31037/2024 which was filed on 14/11/2024 and same is still pending. Copy of the sale certificate and the printout of status of WP No.31037/2024 are marked as Annexure-C and D. 

The 2nd Respondent had challenged the sale certificate issued in favour of the Petitioner in SA No.604/2024 and said case was also dismissed on merits on 28/03/2025 and orders passed therein is produced as Annexure-E.  

WP No.13210/2025 which was filed by 2nd Respondent before this Hon’ble Court by challenging the sale notice came to be dismissed on 29/04/2025 and orders passed therein is produced as Annexure-F. 

This Petitioner has gathered that the 2nd Respondent had hitherto filed a complaint against the bank before the Consumer Fora Udupi in CC no.98/2023 and same is also dismissed on 20/11/2024 and orders passed therein is produced as Annexure-G. Upon going through the averments of the said orders, it is seen that, the 2nd Respondent had made bald allegations in the said case also that important documents and valuable items worth Rs.20,00,000/- were there in the car and same modus operandi has been carried forward by the 2nd Respondent in the matter of filing the complaint by falsely claiming that Lakhs of worth valuables were inside the premises when the same was seized by the bank.  

Such being the case, the 2nd Respondent having lost the cases before this Hon’ble Court and the Debts Recovery Tribunal since 2022, in a hasty manner has filed a private complaint before the 1st ACJM Court at Bengaluru in PCR No.1703/2025 by making reckless allegations and on 03/06/2025, after hearing the counsel for the Complainant, the matter was referred for investigation on 19/07/2025 by directing the 1st Respondent to file its report on or before 20/12/2025 and based upon the directions of the 1st ACJM Court at Bengaluru in PCR No.1703/2025, the 1st Respondent has registered FIR in Cr.No.0183/2025 for the offences allegedly punishable U/s. 34, 380 and 448 of IPC on 21/08/2025. Produced herewith certified copies of the complaint and order sheet in PCR No.1703/2025 and FIR in Crime No.0183/2025 and the same are marked as Annexure-H, J and K respectively and this Petitioner is arrayed as Accused No.6. 

As the above proceedings initiated against the Petitioner being frivolous one, the continuation of the above proceedings will be futile and  hence, this petition is filed for quashing the proceedings initiated against the Petitioner in PCR No.1703/2025 on the file of the 1st ACJM Court at Bengaluru and FIR in Crime No.0183/2025 of High Grounds Police Station.  

No other proceedings either past or present is filed or pending on the same cause of action or part of cause of action before this Hon`ble Court or before any other court of law as far as to the knowledge of the Petitioner. The Petitioner having exhausted all remedies and having no alternative and efficacious remedy has filed the above criminal petition for grant of necessary reliefs on the following among other grounds. 

G R O U N D S 

 

The court below without properly appreciating the case put forth by the respondent No.2 since the complaint does not hold the said allegations and does not constitute any offences allegedly committed by the accused No.6/ Petitioner herein or not but, on the contrary, the court below had merely ordered for registering the FIR based on the complaint filed by the respondent No.2 herein. Hence, the order under challenge being not a valid or considered order, the same is liable to be set aside. 

 

The averments made in the complaint by the 2nd respondent do not constitute commission of any of the offences as alleged in the said complaint by this Petitioner. The 2nd respondent except making bald oral allegations, he has not produced any material either oral or documentary for substantiating the said accusations. The court below without examining the contents of the complaint and allegations made therein to satisfy itself whether said allegations constitute offence or not, ordered registering the complaint and hence, the above procedure adopted by the court below is liable to be quashed.  

 

2nd respondent at Para No.3, page No.3 of the complaint has stated that, on 28/06/2023, the accused No.1 to 4 have criminally trespassed his office premises and had seized the same and it is submitted that, as on 28/06/2023, this Petitioner was not at all in picture and nowhere related to the said premises and she had inspected the said property only during October 2024 when the same was brought for sale and as such, when the 2nd Respondent has lost his possession as on 28/06/2023 and there is specific averment that the trespass was allegedly made by the accused No.1 to 4 on 28/06/2023, the question of this Petitioner committing any offence does not arise at all.  

 

Even otherwise, it is submitted that the Bank has taken physical possession of the secured asset through the court commissioner under the provisions of Sec.14 of SARFAESI ACT and as per Sec.32 of SARFAESI ACT, the acts of the persons under the SARFAESI ACT are immuned, in other words,  no suit, prosecution, or other legal proceedings can be filed against the actions initiated under the SARFAESI Act and since the possession of the secured asset was taken by the bank much prior to this Petitioner participating in the auction, the question of this Petitioner having committed any offences as alleged by the Petitioner does not arise at all.  

 

That the impugned order passed by the court below is not sustainable in law. The averments of the Petitioner are false and baseless. Thus, the allegations having not supported by any oral or documentary evidence and as the Petitioner cannot be compelled to face investigation or trial on the basis of bald and baseless allegations and thereby, it is just and appropriate for quashing the proceedings initiated against the Petitioner herein. As the order under challenge being not sustainable in law the same is liable to be quashed. 

 

The allegations made in the complaint are frivolous in nature. None of the accusations constitute commission of offences as alleged by the respondent No.2 herein. None of the ingredients are made out for holding investigation and report. Hence, as no reasons are assigned for referring the complaint for investigation and order being totally frivolous, the above impugned order is liable to be set aside. 

 

In view of the above facts, continuation of the proceedings will only amount to wastage of valuable and precious time of the Hon`ble Court and unwarranted harassment is being faced by the Petitioner at the hands of the 2nd Respondent who is using the media and social media to defame the image of the Petitioner. Hence, it is just and necessary to quash the proceedings initiated against the Petitioner herein. 

 

Looking from any angle the impugned order suffers from illegality and the same is liable to be quashed. The Petitioner craves leave to raise such other grounds as are available at the time of hearing. 

 

P R A Y E R 

 

WHEREFORE, the Petitioner respectfully prays that this Hon`ble Court be pleased to: 

 

Call for records; 

 

Quash/set aside the entire proceedings initiated against the Petitioner in Crime No.0183/2025 of High Grounds police station pursuant to filing of PCR No.1703/2025 on the file of the learned 1st Addl. Chief Judicial Magistrate, Bengaluru which have been assailed herein as Annexure-H and K; 

 

Issue such other order or directions as deems fit in the circumstances of the case and allow the above criminal petition with costs, to meet the ends of justice and equity.

Brief facts of the case: 

 

Bharat Co-Op Bank (Mumbai) Ltd., had advanced loan to the respondent No.2 and his firm M/s. Unnathi Career Academy and to secure the said loan, the Resp.No.2 had mortgaged his office premises bearing No.4706, High point 4, 7th Floor, Bengaluru and owing to the default committed in repayment of the said loan, Bharat Co-Op Bank (Mumbai) Ltd., had initiated actions against the secured asset under the SARFAESI Act and since the Petitioner has her office in the same building at 4th floor had come across about the sale of the said property and had shown interest to participate in the bid and the representative of Bharat Co-Op Bank (Mumbai) Ltd., had shown the said property prior to the Petitioner bidding in the auction and the said property was under the lock and custody of Bharat Co-Op Bank (Mumbai) Ltd., and same was vacant when the Petitioner had visited for inspection. 

 

2nd respondent at Para No.3, page No.3 of the complaint has stated that, on 28/06/2023, the accused No.1 to 4 have criminally trespassed his office premises and had seized the same and it is submitted that, as on 28/06/2023, this Petitioner was not at all in picture and nowhere related to the said premises and she had inspected the said property only during October 2024 when the same was brought for sale and as such, when the 2nd Respondent has lost his possession as on 28/06/2023 and there is specific averment that the trespass was allegedly made by the accused No.1 to 4 on 28/06/2023, the question of this Petitioner committing any offence does not arise at all.  

 

The petitioner has filed the above criminal petition being aggrieved by the impugned registration of FIR in Cr.No.0183/2025 by the High Grounds Police station the respondent No.1 on the basis of false and baseless private complaint filed by the Respondent No.2 without properly appreciating the facts of the case to arrive at reasonable conclusion, whether the said allegations constitute commission of offences or not by the Petitioner.  

 

It appears that the 2nd Respondent having lost all the cases filed by him by challenging the actions of the bank and having lost the property mortgaged has ventured to cause harm to the Petitioner in one or the other manner and has thus filed a false complaint and based upon the same FIR has been registered and by taking undue advantage of the same, the 2nd Respondent is causing lot of defamation to the Petitioner by misusing media and social media.  

 

Hence, the above criminal petition is filed for granting necessary reliefs, to meet the ends of justice and equity by quashing the FIR and Complaint against the Petitioner herein.
